## 1.1.1 — 2026-10-05

Windows correctness. Found by making the test suite run on Windows for the
first time.

- **Fixed: receipts were platform-dependent on Windows.** `receipt.py` decoded
  git's output with the platform locale (cp1252 on Windows) instead of UTF-8.
  A non-ASCII filename (`café.py`) was recorded as `cafÃ©.py`, matched no
  file, and its content hash was silently dropped while `create` still
  exited 0 — the exact failure the `-z` parser exists to prevent, re-opened
  by decoding. `diff_sha256` for the same commit also differed between a
  receipt written on Windows and one written on Linux whenever the diff held
  a non-ASCII byte. All git calls now decode as UTF-8 explicitly. A new test
  compares the receipt's hashes against git's raw bytes with no text decoding
  at all, so this holds on every platform. Receipts already written on
  Windows for commits with non-ASCII paths or diffs attest the mangled
  values; they still verify (they are internally consistent) but do not match
  what Linux computes for that commit.
- **Tests run on Windows.** The suite's shell helpers used `shell=True`,
  which is cmd.exe on Windows — single quotes, `&&` chains and `VAR=x cmd`
  prefixes all broke, so 25 of 60 tests died at fixture setup and the suite
  could only be trusted on Linux. Helpers now run through a resolved POSIX
  shell (Git for Windows' bash; never System32's WSL launcher), paths fed to
  the shell use forward slashes, and the one NTFS-illegal filename case is
  skipped on Windows. CI now runs `windows-latest` alongside `ubuntu-latest`.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-10-03

Positioning: an audit trail for AI-written code, with the provenance auditors
actually ask about.

- **Provenance block** on every receipt: `ai_assisted` with its `basis`
  (commit trailers and/or the Claude Code hook), `recorder`, and — when
  written by the Claude Code hook — `session_id`, `tool_use_id`,
  `permission_mode`, `models` and `claude_code_version` read from the session
  transcript, plus the transcript's line count and sha256 at receipt time.
  All signed; flipping `ai_assisted` breaks verification. Environment is
  trusted only when `CLAUDECODE` is set.
- **Commit author and timestamp** recorded (`commit.author`, `commit.committed_at`).
- **Full coverage**: `init` vendors the verifier into `.titan/tools/` and
  installs a git `post-commit` hook, so human commits are receipted too
  (`ai_assisted: false`). The git hook defers inside Claude Code so the richer
  receipt wins; it never fails a commit. `install-hook` re-installs per clone;
  `init --no-git-hook` opts out.
- **`/receipt-report`**: markdown evidence — receipted commits, AI-assisted
  share, by recorder / author / month, models and tool versions, chain
  verification result, and a mandatory what-it-does-not-prove footer. v1.0
  receipts (no provenance) are reported as "unknown", never as human.
- **`verify --structure-only`**: chain + content hashes without the key, for
  CI clones that don't hold the secret; output states signatures were not checked.
- **GitHub Action** (`action.yml`): `uses: Rmasood1122/titan-gate-plugin@v1.1.0`
  with optional `key` secret and `report` path.
- README rewritten around the problem with a real receipt; limits in a
  collapsed section, expanded (coverage, recorded-claims). Skill updated to match.
- **Hook over-claim guard**: the PostToolUse hook now receipts only when the
  command was a real `git commit` (not `git log | grep commit`), the tool
  reported success, and HEAD is fresh — a failed commit in a Claude session
  can no longer receipt the human's existing HEAD as AI-assisted.
- `install-hook` refuses (exit 1, with instructions) when an existing
  post-commit hook is not a shell script, ends in `exit`/`exec`, or is
  husky-managed — never claims coverage it cannot deliver. `init` on an
  already-initialised repo now still vendors tools and installs the hook.
- Suite: 53 tests (was 25).

## 1.0.0

- Initial release: hash-chained HMAC receipts, fail-closed chain rules,
  PostToolUse auto-receipting, offline verification, receipt-integrity skill.
