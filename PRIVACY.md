# Privacy

titan-receipts collects nothing.

- All commands run local Python (stdlib only) inside your own repository.
- No network calls, no telemetry, no accounts. Nothing leaves your machine.
- Receipts record git metadata your repo already contains (paths, hashes,
  commit trailers) and are written into your repo, under your control.
- The signing key is generated locally and gitignored; this plugin never
  transmits it anywhere.
