description: Generate a markdown compliance report from the receipt chain — AI-assisted share, by author/month/recorder, models and tool versions recorded, chain verification result, honest limits
argument-hint: "[--out docs/ai-change-receipts.md]"
---

Produce the report:

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/core/receipt.py" report $ARGUMENTS
```

How to present it:

- The **Verification** section is the point. If the chain is BROKEN or any
  signature is invalid, lead with that — do not summarize the counts as if
  they were trustworthy, and never offer to "clean up" receipts so the report
  looks better. The failure is the finding.
- The AI-assisted share counts only receipted commits. Commits made before
  `/receipt-init`, or outside both hooks, have no receipt. Say so if the user
  is about to quote a percentage to an auditor.
- The "What this report proves — and does not" footer stays in the document.
  If the user wants to drop it for a cleaner look, decline and explain: a
  report that overclaims is worse than no report.
- Framework mapping (SOC 2 CC8.1, HIPAA change control, PCI-DSS §6, ISO
  42001, EU AI Act record-keeping): offer it as input to THEIR auditor's
  judgement, never as a conclusion. The receipt-integrity skill has the safe
  sentence template.
