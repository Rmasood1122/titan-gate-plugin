description: Verify the full receipt chain offline — structure (single unbroken chain from GENESIS, content hashes) and every HMAC signature; --structure-only when no key is present
argument-hint: "[--structure-only]"
---

Verify everything:

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/core/receipt.py" verify $ARGUMENTS
```

Report the result exactly as it is:

- **PASS** means: every receipt's content is unchanged since signing, the
  chain is a single unbroken line from GENESIS, and every signature checks
  out under the repo's key. Include the tool's own caveat when you relay
  the result: PASS does not identify WHO signed — HMAC is a shared secret.
- **PASS (structure only)** means the chain and content hashes are
  consistent but signatures were NOT checked because no key was available.
  Relay that limitation verbatim; it is a weaker claim.
- **CHAIN FAIL / SIG FAIL** names the exact receipt. Do not delete or edit
  it to get to green; the failure IS the finding. Help the user diff the
  offending receipt against git history to see what changed and when.
- **SIGNATURES NOT CHECKED (exit 2)** means this checkout has no
  `.titan/key` — typically a fresh clone. The structural walk still ran and
  its result is real; say so, then say signatures could not be verified and
  the key must be obtained out-of-band. Never call this a PASS.
- **ANCHOR** (always printed last) says how many receipts are committed and
  pushed. Relay it every time, even on PASS: a chain that verifies but exists
  only on this machine is not yet evidence to anyone else — the key-holder
  could rewrite it. If anything is untracked/uncommitted/unpushed, give the
  exact command: `git add .titan/attestations && git commit && git push`.

This runs fully offline — no network, no service, just the files, the key,
and local git metadata.
