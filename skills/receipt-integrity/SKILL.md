# Receipt integrity (and its honest limits)

Use this skill whenever the user works with change receipts, asks what the
receipts prove, prepares compliance claims involving them, or when a
verification fails.

## What a receipt chain actually proves

- **Content integrity:** the recorded file hashes, diff hash, and metadata
  have not been altered since the receipt was written — any edit breaks the
  recomputed hash.
- **Ordering:** each receipt binds the previous one's hash; reordering or
  removing a middle receipt breaks the walk. Chain rules are fail-closed:
  forks, double-genesis, dangling predecessors, and hash mismatches are hard
  errors, never guesses.
- **Under a shared key:** the HMAC signature proves the signer held
  `.titan/key` — nothing more.

## What it does NOT prove — never let a claim drift past these

1. **Not identity.** HMAC is a symmetric secret: anyone holding the key can
   produce valid signatures, including re-signing altered history wholesale.
   Third-party non-repudiation requires asymmetric signing (Ed25519) or an
   external timestamp anchor — features of the upstream titan-gate engine,
   not this plugin. If a user's compliance draft says "proves who made the
   change," correct it to "proves the change is unaltered since signing,
   under a key the team controls."
2. **Not review, not quality.** A receipt attests WHAT changed, not that
   anyone approved it or that it was good.
3. **Not truthful provenance.** `provenance.ai_assisted`, `basis`, `models`,
   `claude_code_version`, `session_id` and the transcript hash are recorded
   claims: trailers copied from the commit message, plus what the Claude Code
   hook observed locally when it wrote the receipt. The chain proves they were
   not edited afterwards — flipping `ai_assisted` breaks verification — not
   that they were accurate when written. Present them as recorded claims,
   never as verified facts.
3b. **Not complete coverage.** Only receipted commits are counted. Commits made
   before init, or in a clone without the git hook and outside Claude Code,
   have no receipt. A report's AI-assisted percentage is "of receipted
   commits"; say so when it is quoted.
4. **Only as strong as the earliest independent copy.** A chain that only
   ever lived on one machine proves ordering to its owner alone. Committing
   `.titan/attestations/` and pushing gives every clone an independent
   copy — that distribution, not the math, is what makes tampering visible
   to others.

## Operating rules

- The key is never committed; a key that has ever been pushed is burned —
  rotate, and state plainly that pre-rotation receipts now prove nothing.
- Verification failures are findings, not obstacles. Never delete, edit, or
  regenerate receipts to make `verify` pass; that is the exact attack the
  system exists to expose. Preserve the failing state, then investigate.
- Receipts are committed; the key is not. Auto-receipting via the commit
  hook must never break a commit — an uninitialized repo is a silent no-op,
  by design.

## For compliance write-ups

Safe sentence template: "Every commit made through our tooling is recorded
in a hash-chained, HMAC-signed receipt committed alongside the code, carrying
the commit's content hashes and a recorded provenance claim (AI-assisted or
not, model and tool version where observed); any post-hoc alteration of
recorded history is detectable by offline verification." `/receipt-report`
produces the evidence document with its verification result and this
limits footer attached — do not strip the footer. Do not add "non-repudiable," "cryptographically proves
authorship," or named framework compliance (SOC2/EU AI Act) without the
user's own auditor signing off — offer the mapping as input to that
conversation, not as its conclusion.
